      <h2>Happy 2-Year Anniversary!🥺🫂🫀 🎉</h2>
      <p>I know you’re peacefully asleep right now (probably dreaming about me😋), but when you wake up and read this, I hope it puts the biggest, brightest smile on your face—because you deserve nothing less.🥹🫂🫀
Can you believe it’s already been two whole years of “us”?💕🐰  Two years filled with laughter, little arguments, endless conversations, and so many memories I’ll cherish forever. You’ve made my world brighter, and every single day with you feels like a blessing.🥹🐰  
Pigi, you’re my sunshine when the skies are gray, my partner in every silly adventure, and the reason my heart feels so full. You’ve shown me just how magical love can be, and sometimes I still can’t believe I get to call you mine.🧿🐰 💖
Thank you for being you—for your kindness, your quirks, and for loving me the way you do. These two years are just the beginning of our beautiful forever, and I’m so excited to see everything the future has in store for us.💕🫀💌🫂🥹
So, when you wake up, just know that someone loves you more than words could ever express. Thank you for being my Pigi, my best friend, and my everything.
Yours, always,🥺🫂🫀
Prantik 🐻❤️
